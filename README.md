We distribute the tasks, but in the end we can't combine them and make it work. So, the one we used for presentation is casestudy.js which shows the easiest way (initialized variables) but meet the requirements. We originally tried to make it for user can prompt the data needed but we can't make it work when combining the final code. So, we provide other separate files based on the tasks distributed among us in case you need to see how each one of us do our part before trying to combine them.
